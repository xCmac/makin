I create `makin` to make initial malware assessment little bit easier for me, I think it's useful for others as well, It helps to reveal a debugger detection techniques used by a sample.

##### Any feedback is greatly appreciated: [@_qaz_qaz](https://twitter.com/_qaz_qaz)

#### Note: ~~Only supports x64~~ Supports x64 and x86. Works on Windows 10.

### How does it work?
`makin` opens a sample as a debuggee and injects `asho.dll`(main module renames all `dlls` before injection), `asho.dll` hooks several functions at `ntdll.dll` and `kernelbase.dll` libraries and after parameters checkings, it sends the corresponding message to the debugger (`makin.exe`).

`makin` also generates a script for IDA Pro to set breakpoints at detected APIs.

At this moment, `makin` can reveal following techniques:

* `RegOpenKeyExInternalW` - checks registry keys
* `RegQueryValueExW` - checks registry key values

You can add more VM checks via editing `checks.json` file, without modification of the executable

That's all for now, you can add as much as you wish :) 

External dependencies:
* [Capstone engine](http://www.capstone-engine.org/)
* [JSON for Modern C++](https://github.com/nlohmann/json)

`Note`: You can use [vcpkg](https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg) for external dependencies.

### TODO: 
* [DONE] ~~Use a disassembler such as [capstone](http://www.capstone-engine.org/) to hook little bit deeper and avoid simple hook checks.~~

* [DONE] ~~~At this moment, `makin` does not support child processes.~~~

* [Partial] ~~~Add more tricks.~~~~ Add more tricks.

* [DONE] ~~x86 support~~

* [DONE] ~~~hook `kernelbase.dll`~~~

* [Partial] ~~~Add anti-vm, anti-emulation tricks detection.~~~ Add more tricks.

* [DONE] ~~~Generate IDA Pro script to set BPs at detected APIs~~~
